== Introduction

Welcome to TunedIn, a free-to-use application that brings to you the power of a full-fledged command line personal
organizer, bundled together with a user-friendly interface that keeps all of your information easily accessible and
at your fingertips.

With TunedIn, we keep things simple yet efficient for you, so you can focus on the things you love.

TunedIn is a free-to-use application. If you paid for this software, contact the seller immediately and request for a
refund.

== The TunedIn Way

We believe in the freedom of information, and the value of aesthetics. TunedIn is a reflection of what we believe
strongly in, echoed strongly by our firm intention to keep the application free-to-use. In our development, we put a
heavy emphasis on our design pedagogy, and we recognize that aesthetics are just as important as functionality. No
cohesive application functions well without a unified design structure, which is why we allowed for maximum
customizability in our application as much as possible.

We continue to strive and innovate to bring TunedIn to the next level, in a harmonious and non-invasive way to
complement our daily lives. Feedback is always welcome at hello@tunedinapp.com, we'd be happy to hear how we can
improve TunedIn.

== Commands

TunedIn is a Command Line Application (CLI), and we have no plans to do otherwise. Operations are carried out on
TunedIn using Commands, which can be keyed in in the command field. We have a variety of commands on TunedIn to interact
with Contact List, Event List and the app Theme. All the commands together with their usage are listed below.
We are constantly striving to expand this list of commands, feel free
to contact us if you have any suggestions for commands.

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
