=== Enhancement Added: Aliases

==== External behavior

---

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=alias]

---

==== Justification

Themes make application more visually appealing, enhancing the user experience and user satisfaction when using the
TunedIn application.

==== Implementation

---
include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=alias]
---

=== Enhancement Added: Theme

==== External behavior

---

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=theme]

---

==== Justification

Aliases make operating the application easier and quicker, as users can set their own custom defined
aliases which they can easily remember, and execute commands using our CLI.

==== Implementation

---
include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=theme]
---

=== Enhancement Added: Transfer

==== External behavior

---

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=transfer]

---

==== Justification

Transfer allows users to transfer data from device to device seamlessly, without having to worry about the loss
of data.

==== Implementation

---
include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=theme]
---

=== Enhancement Proposed: Custom Theme

Allowing users to set their own custom themes will allow them to further personalize TunedIn, which fits in with our
target users, allowing them to add their own dimension for user customizability. On top of that, users are also able to
 upload and share their themes on TunedInLive, for other users to download and use.

==== External behavior

---
include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=customtheme]
---

==== Justification

The ability for users to set their own theme confers upon them the level of customizability that we hope to achieve
with TunedIn. Furthermore, by allowing them to download themes from other users, we aim to create a vibrant community
using TunedIn, extending it to fit their everyday lives.

=== Enhancement Proposed: Facebook Connect

With so many online address books with a plethora of information, it is much easier if we are able to pull data which
is readily accessible into the address book.

==== External behavior

---
include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=connect]
---

==== Justification

This reduces the need for users to manually enter data sequentially, from existing data that they already have access
to, such as on Facebook.

=== Enhancement Proposed: Online Backup

Storing data in the cloud is no abstract concept for even the least technologically inclined users, and we intend to
bring this level of security for users too

==== External behavior

---
include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=sync]
---

==== Justification

With users possibly using TunedIn across multiple devices, the ability to ensure that TunedIn is synchronized across
multiple devices is of paramount importance to us. Keeping this data backed up in the Cloud, and subsequently pushing
it across multiple devices, ensures that users have access to their information, accurate anywhere.
